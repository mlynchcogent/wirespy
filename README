=== Wire Spy Daemon (WSD)

by Ron Dilley <ron.dilley@uberadmin.com>

For the latest information on wsd, please see:

== What is wsd?

== Why use it?

== Security Implications

Assume that there are errors in the wsd source that
would allow a specially crafted packet to allow an attacker
to exploit wsd to gain access to the computer that wsd is
running on!!!  wsd tries to get rid of priviledges it does
not need and can run in a chroot environment.  I recommend
that you use the chroot and uid/gid options.  They are there
to compensate for my poor programming skills.  Don't trust
this software and install and use is at your own risk.

== Bugs

I am not a programmer by any strech of the imagination.  I
have attempted to remove the obvious bugs and other
programmer related errors but please keep in mind the first
sentence.  If you find an issue with code, please send me
an e-mail with details and I will be happy to look into
it.
